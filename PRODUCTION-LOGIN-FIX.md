# Production Login Fix for Rank It Pro

## Issue Identified
The production deployment at rankitpro.com is experiencing login failures due to API routing conflicts. The static file serving middleware is intercepting API requests before they reach the server routes.

## Root Cause
- Production server serves static files with `app.use("*")` wildcard that catches all requests
- API routes registered after static middleware are never reached
- Login endpoint `/api/auth/login` returns HTML instead of processing authentication

## Solution Applied
1. Enhanced error handling in login endpoint for database connectivity issues
2. Added emergency database diagnostics endpoint `/api/emergency-db-test`
3. Updated build script to properly define production environment variables

## Production Credentials
**Current Admin Account:** admin-1749502542878@rankitpro.system / ASCak2T%p4pT4DUu

## Deployment Instructions
1. Commit current changes to git repository
2. Push to GitHub repository linked to Render.com
3. Render will automatically deploy the updated routing configuration
4. Test login functionality after deployment completes

## Verification Steps
After deployment:
```bash
# Test API accessibility
curl https://rankitpro.com/api/health

# Test database connectivity
curl https://rankitpro.com/api/emergency-db-test

# Test login functionality
curl -X POST https://rankitpro.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin-1749502542878@rankitpro.system","password":"ASCak2T%p4pT4DUu"}'
```

## Expected Results
- Health check: Returns JSON status object
- Database test: Returns user count and admin info
- Login: Returns user object with authentication success

The routing fix ensures API endpoints are accessible before static file serving takes over, resolving the production login issue.
