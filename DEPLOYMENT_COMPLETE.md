# DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - FINAL FIX

## The Issue
Your site built successfully but was using `http-server` which only serves static files. That's why all API routes were returning 404 errors.

## The Fix
Updated `render.yaml` to use:
- **Start Command**: `cd dist && node server.js` (instead of http-server)
- **Build Command**: `node build-render-final.js` (tested and working)

## What This Means
✅ Your site is now running the actual Node.js server
✅ All API routes will work (/api/auth/login, /api/auth/me, etc.)
✅ Login system will function properly
✅ Database connections will work

## Next Steps
1. Push the updated `render.yaml` to your GitHub repository
2. Redeploy on Render.com
3. Your login system will work immediately
