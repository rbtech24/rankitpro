# FINAL DEPLOYMENT FIXES

## Issue Identified
Render.com is still using the old build command and not finding the server.js file in the correct location.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated render.yaml
- Changed start command from `node dist/server.js` to `node server.js`
- This avoids the directory path confusion

### 2. Updated deploy-truly-final.js
- Now copies server.js to root directory as well as dist/
- Handles both path scenarios: `./server.js` and `./dist/server.js`

### 3. Alternative Manual Fix for Render.com
If the yaml file doesn't take effect, manually update your Render service:

**Build Command:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules && npm install && node deploy-truly-final.js
```

**Start Command:**
```bash
node server.js
```

## Key Changes Made
- Server.js now gets copied to both locations
- Start command simplified to avoid path issues
- Build verification enhanced

This should resolve the "Cannot find module" error completely.
