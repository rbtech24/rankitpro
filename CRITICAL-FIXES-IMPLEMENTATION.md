*Generated: June 15, 2025*

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Analytics Service Implementation ✓
- Created comprehensive analytics service with real data endpoints
- Added `/api/admin/analytics`, `/api/admin/system/health`, `/api/admin/system/settings`
- Implemented proper data structures to replace empty objects
- Fixed chart component imports (Pie chart from recharts)

### 2. Admin Dashboard Data Structure ✓

- Connected real data sources to admin dashboards

## Remaining Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Storage Layer TypeScript Errors
- Iterator compatibility issues (downlevelIteration flag needed)
- Null safety violations in date comparisons
- Type mismatches in storage interface implementations
- Duplicate function implementations

### 2. Schema Reference Issues
- Missing apiKeys, salesPersons, commissions references
- Type conflicts between DatabaseStorage and IStorage
- Undefined property access patterns

### 3. Component Import Issues  
- Chart component resolution
- Type safety in component props
- Interface alignment issues

## System Status
- Analytics endpoints: ✅ Functional
- Admin dashboards: ✅ Connected to real data
- TypeScript compilation: ⚠️ Some remaining errors
- Server functionality: ✅ Operational

## Next Steps Required
1. Fix storage layer type issues
2. Resolve schema reference problems
3. Complete TypeScript compilation cleanup
4. Final system verification
