# Plugin Version 1.2.0 Verification

## Current Status
✓ WordPress plugin updated to version 1.2.0
✓ Dashboard now shows v1.2.0 
✓ API Domain field added to plugin settings
✓ Development URL support implemented

## How to Verify You Have the Correct Version

### Method 1: Check Dashboard Display
In your RankIt Pro dashboard > WordPress Plugin page, you should see:
- "Rank It Pro Plugin v1.2.0"
- Not v1.0.0

### Method 2: Check Plugin File Header
After downloading, open the plugin PHP file and verify:
```
* Version: 1.2.0
```

### Method 3: WordPress Admin Check
After installing in WordPress, the settings page should have:
- Company ID field
- API Domain field (this is the key difference from v1.0.0)
- Cache Time field

## Configuration Required
Once you have v1.2.0 installed:
1. Company ID: 16
2. API Domain: https://3ba12234-e3a1-4984-9152-1724cec12a3c-00-3d1awbp5bhqqy.kirk.replit.dev
3. Cache Time: 300

The API Domain field is what was missing in v1.0.0 and causing the "No check-ins available" message.
