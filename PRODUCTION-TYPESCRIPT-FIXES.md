# Production TypeScript Fixes Implementation

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Duplicate Function Implementations
- Multiple duplicate method implementations in DatabaseStorage class
- This prevents TypeScript compilation and deployment

### 2. Type Mismatches
- Property name mismatches between schema and implementation
- Missing properties in interfaces

### 3. Visibility Issues
- Private methods being called publicly
- Interface contract violations

## Fix Strategy

1. Remove all duplicate function implementations
2. Fix property name mismatches with database schema
3. Ensure all interface contracts are properly implemented
4. Make required methods public

This will ensure clean TypeScript compilation for production deployment.
