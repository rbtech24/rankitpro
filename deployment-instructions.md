# Deployment Instructions

## Build Process Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Build Command
- **Issue**: `vite build client` was causing path alias resolution errors
- **Fix**: Created `deploy-build.sh` script that runs `npx vite build` from root directory
- **Result**: Path aliases now resolve correctly during build

### 2. Added Environment Variables
- **Issue**: Missing `REPLIT_KEEP_PACKAGE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES` caused build dependency issues
- **Fix**: Added environment variable to `.env.production` and build script
- **Result**: Build dependencies remain available during deployment

### 3. Updated Server Build External Dependencies
- **Issue**: Babel and lightningcss dependencies causing build failures
- **Fix**: Added `--external:@babel/core --external:lightningcss --external:typescript` to esbuild command
- **Result**: Server builds successfully with reduced bundle size

### 4. Path Alias Configuration Verified
- **Issue**: Rollup couldn't resolve '@' path alias during production build
- **Fix**: Verified `vite.config.ts` has correct path alias configuration
- **Result**: All import statements resolve correctly

## Deployment Commands

### For Render.com:
```bash
# Build Command
./deploy-build.sh

# Start Command  
node dist/index.js
```

### For Replit Deployments:
```bash
# Use the deploy-build.sh script
./deploy-build.sh
```

### Manual Build Testing:
```bash
# Test the build process locally
./deploy-build.sh

# Verify files are created
ls -la dist/
ls -la dist/public/
```

## Build Output
- **Client**: `dist/public/` (HTML, CSS, JS assets)
- **Server**: `dist/index.js` (Bundled Node.js application)

## Environment Variables Required
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `REPLIT_KEEP_PACKAGE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES=1`
- Database and API keys as configured in your environment

## Build Status
✅ Client build working correctly
✅ Server build working with minor warnings
✅ Path aliases resolving properly
✅ External dependencies handled correctly
