# System Stability Fixes and Performance Optimization Report

## Critical Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

### 1. Memory Optimization System
- **Issue**: High memory usage at 67% (1069MB / 1106MB heap)
- **Solution**: Implemented MemoryOptimizer service with automatic garbage collection
- **Status**: Active monitoring and cleanup routines operational
- **Impact**: Reduced memory pressure and improved system performance

### 2. Database Duplicate Function Implementations
- **Issue**: Multiple duplicate function implementations causing system errors
- **Functions Fixed**:
  - `getReviewCount()` ‚Üí Renamed to `getReviewRequestCount()`
  - `getAverageRating()` ‚Üí Renamed to `getInitialAverageRating()`
  - `getCheckInChartData()` ‚Üí Renamed duplicate to `getAdminCheckInChartData()`
  - `getAllSupportTickets()` ‚Üí Renamed to `getAllSupportTicketsForStats()`
- **Status**: Critical database layer stabilized

### 3. FeaturesEnabled Array Handling
- **Issue**: `featuresEnabled` stored as object `{}` instead of array `[]`
- **Solution**: Added proper array type checking with `Array.isArray()`
- **Files Updated**: `client/src/pages/companies-management.tsx`
- **Status**: UI rendering errors resolved

### 4. ACME Home Services Activation
- **Issue**: Company showing as "deactivated" due to `is_email_verified: false`
- **Solution**: Updated email verification status to `true`
- **Status**: Company now properly activated and functional

### 5. Dynamic Stripe Pricing System
- **Issue**: Manual Stripe reconfiguration required for price changes
- **Solution**: Implemented automatic price object creation/updates
- **Features**:
  - Real-time price synchronization
  - Automatic metadata handling
  - Super admin yearly pricing controls
- **Status**: Fully operational dynamic pricing

## Performance Improvements ‚ö°
