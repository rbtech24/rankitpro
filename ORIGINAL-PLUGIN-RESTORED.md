# Original WordPress Plugin Restored with Enhanced Debugging

## Status: Fixed
The download now serves your original "RankItPro Service Integration" plugin with enhanced debugging features.

## What You Should Do
1. **Delete both plugins** from WordPress admin:
   - "Rank It Pro Integration" (v1.2.0) 
   - "RankItPro Service Integration" (v1.2.1)

2. **Download fresh plugin** from your dashboard
   - It will now be the original plugin with v1.2.1 and enhanced debugging

3. **Install the new download** and configure:
   - Company ID: 16
   - API Domain: https://3ba12234-e3a1-4984-9152-1724cec12a3c-00-3d1awbp5bhqqy.kirk.replit.dev

## Enhanced Debugging Features
The updated plugin includes:
- Detailed console logging for troubleshooting
- Container validation before script execution  
- Better error messages
- Content loading verification

## Testing
After installation:
1. Add `[rankitpro_checkins]` shortcode to any page
2. Check browser console (F12 > Console) for debug messages
3. Look for "RankItPro: Initializing widget for company 16"

This will help identify exactly why the service reports aren't displaying.
