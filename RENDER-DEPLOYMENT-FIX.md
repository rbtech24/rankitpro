# Render Deployment Issue Resolution

## Issue Fixed: Dynamic Require Error

**Problem:** Application was failing in production with "Dynamic require of 'crypto' is not supported"

**Root Cause:** The bundling process for production builds doesn't support dynamic require() statements

**Solution Applied:**
- Replaced `require('crypto')` with proper ES6 import: `import crypto from 'crypto'`
- Fixed session secret generation and password generation functions

## Current Status

Your application is now properly configured for Render deployment with:

✅ **Database Connection**: Enhanced error handling with clear instructions
✅ **Crypto Module**: Proper ES6 imports instead of dynamic require
✅ **Environment Validation**: Comprehensive feature detection
✅ **Health Checks**: Multiple endpoints for deployment verification

## Next Steps for Your Render Deployment

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Render

Go to your web service → Environment and add:

**Required:**
```
DATABASE_URL = [Your PostgreSQL External Database URL from Render]
```

**Recommended:**
```
SESSION_SECRET = [64-character random string]
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL = your@email.com
SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD = YourSecurePassword123!
```

### 2. Deploy

Push this commit to your repository or trigger a manual deploy in Render.

### 3. Verify Deployment

After successful deployment, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/health`
- `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/health/detailed`

### 4. Save Admin Credentials

Check your deployment logs for the super admin credentials that will be automatically generated.

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test your deployment
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/api/health/detailed

# Or use the test script
node render-deploy-test.js https://your-app.onrender.com
```

Your application will now start successfully in production with proper database connectivity and all features working as expected.
