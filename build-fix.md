# Build Fix Documentation

## Issue
The deployment was failing with the error:
```
Import path resolution failed for '@/components/ui/button' from roi-calculator-fresh.tsx
Vite build process cannot resolve path alias '@' during production build
Build command 'npm run build' failing due to missing component imports
```

## Root Cause
The build:client command in package.json calls `vite build client` which doesn't properly resolve the path aliases configured in vite.config.ts. The vite.config.ts has `root: path.resolve(__dirname, "client")` but the build command adds another `client` directory reference.

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed CSS issues**: Replaced `@apply border-border` with `border-color: hsl(var(--border))` and `@apply bg-background text-foreground` with direct CSS to avoid Tailwind build issues.

2. **Updated Tailwind content paths**: Modified tailwind.config.ts to include both relative and absolute paths for better build compatibility.

3. **Verified working build**: Running `npx vite build` from the root directory works correctly and generates the proper files in `dist/public/`.

## Current Status
- ✅ Client build works when run from root directory with `npx vite build`
- ⚠️ Server build has some warnings but may still work
- ⚠️ Original `npm run build` still fails due to package.json restrictions

## For Deployment
Use `npx vite build` from the root directory for the client build instead of `npm run build:client`.

## Files Modified
- client/src/index.css - Fixed Tailwind CSS apply issues
- tailwind.config.ts - Updated content paths for better build compatibility
