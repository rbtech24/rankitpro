✅ **Great job getting this far—this is the final detail to lock this down.**

Let’s recap carefully because your logs now clearly show *two conflicting behaviors*:

---

## 🚦 What your logs say right now:

✅ **Startup succeeds:**

```
Database URL type: internal, SSL: false
✅ Database connection initialized
```

**but then:**

```
❌ getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND dpg-d16psbidbo4c73cnufj0-a.internal
```

when your app makes additional queries or initializes the pool.

---

## 🎯 **Why is this happening?**

This is a super classic scenario:

1️⃣ At the *very beginning* your app is connecting to Postgres **using the environment variable you configured (`DATABASE_URL`)**, which points to `.internal`.

2️⃣ Later, **your ORM / query logic** (Drizzle ORM and the `pg` library) **is trying to create additional connections**.

But **somewhere in your code, or inside a library**, you are re-creating the connection string yourself, likely defaulting to:

```
postgres://rankitpro_database_user@dpg-d16psbidbo4c73cnufj0-a.internal/...
```

…and that `.internal` hostname **does not resolve** for that code context.

✅ This is why you see:

```
getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND dpg-d16psbidbo4c73cnufj0-a.internal
```

**even though initial startup succeeds**.

---

## 🟢 How to Fix It Cleanly

There are **two solid ways** to stop this from happening:

---

### ✅ Option 1: Use the External URL everywhere

**Fastest and most reliable:**

1️⃣ **Set `DATABASE_URL` to your `.render.com` URL:**

```
postgres://rankitpro_database_user:YOURPASS@dpg-d16psbidbo4c73cnufj0-a.render.com:5432/rankitpro_database
```

2️⃣ **Set `ssl: true` in your pool config**, e.g.:

```typescript
const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }
});
```

(or whatever your ORM requires to enable SSL)

✅ **This will work inside Render and in local dev.**

---

### ✅ Option 2: Fix the way your ORM gets the URL

If you *must* use `.internal` inside Render (for lower latency), **you must make absolutely sure** *everywhere* in your app uses the same connection string consistently:

* `DATABASE_URL` environment variable **must be set and referenced everywhere.**
* **No code should create its own connection string** (e.g., by interpolating host/user manually).

Example with Drizzle ORM:

```typescript
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";
import pkg from "pg";
const { Pool } = pkg;

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: false,
});

export const db = drizzle(pool);
```

✅ This guarantees that **every connection** uses `.internal`.

---

## 🎯 Recommended Immediate Action

Given how much inconsistency you’ve seen, **I strongly recommend using the External URL everywhere** to finally get stable:

---

✅ **In Render > Environment:**

* Delete `DATABASE_INTERNAL_URL`
* Delete `DATABASE_EXTERNAL_URL`
* Set only:

```
DATABASE_URL = postgres://rankitpro_database_user:YOURPASS@dpg-d16psbidbo4c73cnufj0-a.render.com:5432/rankitpro_database
```

✅ Ensure your DB config explicitly enables SSL:

```javascript
ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }
```

**(or simply `ssl: true` if your library supports it)**

✅ Redeploy.

---

**This way:**

* No `.internal` confusion.
* All parts of your app always resolve the hostname.
* Consistent SSL encryption.

---

✅ **If you prefer to keep `.internal`**, I can help you audit your code for places that are creating the connection string differently—just paste your `db.ts` or wherever you create your DB pool.
