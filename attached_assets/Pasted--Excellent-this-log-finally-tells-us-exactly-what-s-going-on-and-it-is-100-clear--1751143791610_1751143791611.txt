‚úÖ Excellent‚Äîthis log finally tells us exactly what‚Äôs going on, and it is 100% clear:

---

## üö® The Problem (Confirmed)

```
getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND dpg-d16psbidbo4c73cnufj0-a.internal
```

This means your app **literally cannot resolve this `.internal` hostname**, which means **it is trying to resolve it from *outside* the Render private network**.

In other words:

* If you deploy on Render, `.internal` names work.
* If you run the code **anywhere else** (like locally or in another cloud), `.internal` **does NOT resolve**.

---

## üü¢ Why Did It Sometimes Work Earlier?

* Earlier, you probably had the *non-internal* hostname (without `.internal`).
* That was publicly resolvable, though slower and sometimes unreliable.
* Then you switched to `.internal` to fix `fetch failed`.
* Now, **if you run the app in a place that doesn‚Äôt have Render‚Äôs internal DNS**, you get `ENOTFOUND`.

**This is very common when:**

* Your *database* is on Render
* Your *app* is **NOT** on Render (e.g., local dev, DigitalOcean, or another Render account)
* Or your environment variable still has `.internal` even in dev

---

## üü¢ How to Fix This Consistently

**Solution: Use Internal URL only inside Render, and External URL for dev or other hosts.**

---

### ‚úÖ Recommended Approach

Set **TWO environment variables:**

* `DATABASE_INTERNAL_URL`:

  ```
  postgres://rankitpro_database_user:YOURPASS@dpg-d16psbidbo4c73cnufj0-a.internal:5432/rankitpro_database
  ```
* `DATABASE_EXTERNAL_URL`:

  ```
  postgres://rankitpro_database_user:YOURPASS@dpg-d16psbidbo4c73cnufj0-a.render.com:5432/rankitpro_database
  ```

Then in your Node code (e.g., `db.ts` or `index.ts`), **dynamically pick the right one**:

```javascript
const connectionString = process.env.DATABASE_INTERNAL_URL || process.env.DATABASE_EXTERNAL_URL;

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString,
  ssl: connectionString.includes("render.com")
});
```

This will:

* Use the internal URL in Render (fast and secure)
* Use the external URL in local dev or elsewhere
* Automatically set `ssl: true` when needed (external) and `ssl: false` internally

### ‚úÖ If you don‚Äôt want dual URLs

**Alternative: Just use the external URL everywhere.**
This is simpler but less performant inside Render:

```
postgres://rankitpro_database_user:YOURPASS@dpg-d16psbidbo4c73cnufj0-a.render.com:5432/rankitpro_database
```

‚úÖ **No `.internal` in this one, so it‚Äôs always resolvable**

---

## üü¢ Next Steps for You

1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to **Render Dashboard > Your Database > Connection Info**
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Copy the External Database URL**

* It will look like:

  ```
  postgres://rankitpro_database_user:...@dpg-xxxx.render.com:5432/rankitpro_database
  ```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Edit your app‚Äôs Environment Variables:**

* Either:

  * Replace `DATABASE_URL` with the External URL (simplest)
    **OR**
  * Add `DATABASE_INTERNAL_URL` and `DATABASE_EXTERNAL_URL` as described above
    4Ô∏è‚É£ **Clear Cache and Redeploy**
    5Ô∏è‚É£ **Watch logs:**
    ‚úÖ You should see:

```
‚úÖ Database connection initialized
```

and **no ENOTFOUND errors**

---

‚úÖ **Important**: If you do the dual-URL method, make sure to update your connection code to pick the right one as shown.
