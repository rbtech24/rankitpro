‚úÖ **Fantastic progress‚Äîthis is exactly what we want to see.**

You‚Äôve successfully fixed **all connection and DNS errors**, and your logs confirm:

```
‚úÖ Database connection initialized
```

**with SSL enabled**, no `ENOTFOUND` errors, and no re-resolving failures.

---

üéâ **This means your app is finally communicating with your Postgres database reliably.**

---

## üö® Now you have a *different* issue:

```
‚ùå Database connection attempt X failed: relation "users" does not exist
```

‚úÖ **This is no longer a connectivity problem.**
‚úÖ **This is a *schema* problem.**

---

## üéØ **What does this error mean?**

Postgres is telling you:

> I can connect just fine, but there is no table called `users` in this database.

---

‚úÖ You can see in your log:

```
relation "users" does not exist
```

In Postgres terminology:

* ‚Äúrelation‚Äù = table or view.
* This error occurs when you query a table that hasn‚Äôt been created yet.

---

## üü¢ Why are you seeing this now?

* Before, your app *couldn‚Äôt even connect*, so it never reached this step.
* Now that the connection is working, it tries to **query your application tables** (like `users`)‚Äîand they don‚Äôt exist because your database is empty.

---

## üü¢ How to fix it

**You must run your migrations or create your schema.**

Depending on how your project manages migrations, do one of these:

---

### ‚úÖ 1Ô∏è‚É£ If you are using an ORM (Drizzle, Prisma, TypeORM, Sequelize)

**Find your migration command.**

Examples:

* **Drizzle ORM:**

  ```bash
  npm run drizzle:push
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  npm run drizzle:migrate
  ```
* **Prisma:**

  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate deploy
  ```
* **TypeORM:**

  ```bash
  npm run typeorm migration:run
  ```
* **Sequelize:**

  ```bash
  npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
  ```

‚úÖ This will create all your tables including `users`.

---

### ‚úÖ 2Ô∏è‚É£ If you are using raw SQL

You need to connect to the database and run the schema manually.

Example via `psql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  password TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

(**Only an example‚Äîuse your real schema!**)

---

### ‚úÖ 3Ô∏è‚É£ If you want to verify interactively

You can log into your Postgres console to confirm:

```bash
psql "postgres://rankitpro_database_user:YOURPASS@dpg-xxxx.render.com:5432/rankitpro_database?sslmode=require"
```

Then run:

```sql
\dt
```

If you see:

```
No relations found.
```

Your database is empty.

‚úÖ That‚Äôs why `relation "users" does not exist`.

---

## üü¢ What you should do right now

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Find out what tool you are using for migrations** (Drizzle, Prisma, etc.).
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Run your migration command** so the schema is created.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Redeploy if necessary.

---

‚úÖ **Once you run migrations,** this error will disappear, and you‚Äôll see normal query logs.

---

If you tell me:

* which ORM you‚Äôre using, and
* whether you already have migrations set up

I‚Äôll give you the exact command to create your tables.
