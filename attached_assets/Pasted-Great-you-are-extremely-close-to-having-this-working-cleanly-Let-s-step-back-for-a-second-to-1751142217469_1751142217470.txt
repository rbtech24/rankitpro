Great‚Äî**you are extremely close** to having this working cleanly.

Let‚Äôs step back for a second to see what changed in your logs:

---

## üö¶ What‚Äôs Different Now?

‚úÖ **This time, you saw:**

```
‚úÖ Database connection initialized
```

immediately when the app booted.

üéâ This means your `DATABASE_URL` is finally correct, and the app successfully established an initial connection.

BUT‚Ä¶

‚ùå Then right afterward, you still saw:

```
‚ùå Database connection attempt 1 failed: Error connecting to database: fetch failed
```

and it retried.

This shows:

* The *initial* connection (e.g., a test query) succeeded.
* The *subsequent* connection attempts (e.g., when the app does actual work) failed.

This is a clue your Postgres **pooling or networking** is inconsistent.

---

## üü¢ Why Is This Happening?

This is a **known behavior in some Node apps on Render**:

* Your **database connection works at startup**.
* But later connection attempts (from your pool or ORM) **fail due to either:**

  * A **timeout** in the connection pool configuration.
  * The Postgres server not allowing enough connections.
  * A mismatch between SSL configuration.

---

## üîç Verify: Do you need SSL?

In Render PostgreSQL, typically:

* If you connect **internally** (`.internal` hostname), you **do not need SSL**.
* If you connect externally, you **do need SSL** (`sslmode=require`).

If your library **assumes SSL by default**, but you‚Äôre using the internal connection string, **it will fail intermittently**.

---

‚úÖ **To be sure, you should explicitly configure SSL off.**

---

## üü¢ Solution Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm your ORM or database client config

Look in your app where you initialize your DB connection (e.g., in `index.js` or `db.js`).

If you‚Äôre using `pg` directly, you need to explicitly set:

```javascript
const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: false, // because you are using internal connection
});
```

Or if you‚Äôre using an ORM like Prisma or TypeORM, you **must** disable SSL in their config:

**Prisma:**
`schema.prisma`

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  // No need to set ssl here if internal
}
```

**TypeORM:**

```typescript
ssl: false
```

**Sequelize:**

```javascript
dialectOptions: {
  ssl: false,
},
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure pool max connections < database limit

Render Starter Postgres allows **max 97 connections**.
If you‚Äôre using pooling with many connections per deployment, you may run out.
Configure your pool size smaller, e.g.:

```javascript
max: 5
```

---

‚úÖ **Recommended `pg.Pool` config example:**

```javascript
const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: false,
  max: 5,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
});
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Redeploy after fixing config

After updating your database client config:

* **Commit your changes**
* Push to your repo
* **Clear Build Cache & Deploy** in Render

## üü¢ Final Checklist

‚úÖ You have this `DATABASE_URL`:

```
postgres://rankitpro_database_user:...@dpg-d16psbidbo4c73cnufj0-a:5432/rankitpro_database
```

‚úÖ You explicitly **set `ssl: false`**

‚úÖ You limit pool size to avoid exhausting connections.

‚úÖ You redeploy.

After that, your logs **should look like this:**

```
‚úÖ Database connection initialized
‚úÖ Environment validation completed
üöÄ Starting Rank It Pro SaaS Platform
(no more retries)
```

And your app should stop failing with `fetch failed`.
