### 3. Common Issues & Solutions

**If you see "Container not found":**
- WordPress theme is interfering with the shortcode output
- Try adding shortcode to a simple page without theme elements

**If you see "Widget script loaded but no content":**
- The script loads but can't find the widget containers
- This indicates a container detection issue

**If you see "Failed to load widget script":**
- Security plugin blocking external JavaScript
- Try temporarily disabling security/firewall plugins
