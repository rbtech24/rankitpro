## üö® Security Analysis

### High Priority Issues
1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities** (HIGH)
   ```bash
   - multer: Denial of Service vulnerability
   - on-headers: HTTP response header manipulation
   - express-session: Depends on vulnerable on-headers
   ```
   **Fix**: Run `npm audit fix` to update vulnerable packages

2. **Information Disclosure** (MEDIUM)
   - 860+ console.log statements leak sensitive information in production
   - Debug statements visible in server logs
   **Fix**: Replace with structured logging service

3. **DOM Manipulation** (MEDIUM)
   - 11 files using innerHTML/document.write
   - Potential XSS vectors if not properly sanitized
   **Fix**: Use safe DOM manipulation methods

### Security Strengths ‚úÖ
- **Authentication**: Proper bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- **Session Management**: Secure cookie configuration
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation throughout
- **Rate Limiting**: Comprehensive rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- **Headers**: Security headers via Helmet
- **API Security**: API key authentication with SHA-256 hashing
