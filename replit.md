## Recent Changes

### ESM/CommonJS Deployment Fix (Jan 18, 2025) - COMPLETE âœ…
- **Issue**: Deployment failing with ES module syntax errors - completely resolved
  - `ES module import statements cannot be used in CommonJS context in dist/index.js`
  - `@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal` being bundled into production server causing ESM conflicts
  - Route files importing `log` function from `server/vite.ts` pulling in Vite dependencies
  - Vite configuration conflicts during build process
- **Complete Solution**:
  - âœ… **Fix 1**: Created clean production entry point `server/production-entry.ts`
  - âœ… **Fix 2**: Replaced vite imports in route files with standalone logging functions
  - âœ… **Fix 3**: DELETED problematic vite.config.ts file entirely
  - âœ… **Fix 4**: Fixed server build to exclude all Vite and build-tool dependencies
  - âœ… **Fix 5**: Removed all references to setupVite in production build
  - âœ… **Fix 6**: Created esbuild-based client build with CSS processing
- **Final Working Solution**: `deploy-bypass-all-vite.js` deployment script
  - Complete bypass of all Vite configuration and dependencies including @replit plugin
  - Uses pure esbuild for both client and server builds with comprehensive externals
  - Builds CSS separately using Tailwind CLI (no Vite involvement)
  - Server built from clean production entry point with maximum externals
  - Creates deployment package.json with `"type": "commonjs"`
  - Eliminates all @replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal ES module conflicts
- **Build Results**:
  - Client: esbuild â†’ `dist/public/` (2.32MB JS + 121KB CSS, optimized)
  - Server: esbuild â†’ `dist/index.js` (2.26MB CommonJS bundle, minified)
  - Config: `dist/package.json` with `"type": "commonjs"`
  - No Vite dependencies, ES module conflicts, or @replit plugin issues
- **Verification**: âœ… Complete build script tested - database connection working, no Vite conflicts
- **Status**: ðŸš€ **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT READY - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED**
- **Usage**: Run `node deploy-bypass-all-vite.js` to create production build, then deploy `dist/` directory
