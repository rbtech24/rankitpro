Fixed routing issues by moving API credential routes before catch-all handler. Frontend integration examples updated with working cURL commands and authentication patterns. All CRUD operations tested and functional: create, read, deactivate, regenerate API keys.

- July 26, 2025. **Critical Application Startup Errors Resolved** - Fixed major application startup failure caused by duplicated code in server/index.ts (lines 422-536 contained complete duplicate of entire server setup). Removed duplicate imports, app declarations, and server configurations that were causing "The symbol 'app' has already been declared" errors. Fixed TypeScript logger errors by updating error handling to use proper Error objects instead of plain objects with message properties. Corrected NotificationBell.tsx component by removing duplicate variable declarations and properly integrating with useNotifications hook.

Added database storage methods (getAllSubscriptionPlans, createSubscriptionPlan, updateSubscriptionPlan, deleteSubscriptionPlan) to storage.ts implementing real database operations. Updated billing routes (/api/billing/plans GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to use actual database persistence instead of hardcoded responses. All subscription plan operations now dynamically create, read, update, and delete plans from subscription_plans table with proper error handling, validation, and real-time subscriber counts. Admin users can now fully manage subscription plans with immediate database persistence and accurate revenue calculations. System tested and confirmed functional for complete subscription plan lifecycle management.

- July 20, 2025. **Walkthrough Persistence and Duplicate Email Registration Issues Resolved** - Fixed critical onboarding walkthrough issue where completed walkthrough kept reappearing after 5 seconds on dashboard. Root cause: race condition in auto-start logic using stale state variables. Implemented comprehensive fixes: immediate localStorage completion on all exit paths (close, skip, complete buttons), enhanced auto-start logic to check current completion status instead of stale state, added double-verification before auto-start trigger, improved state management in OnboardingProvider. Added specific duplicate email registration popup showing "This email address is already associated with an account. Please try logging in instead or use a different email address" with 6-second duration for better visibility. Walkthrough now stays dismissed permanently once completed through any method.
- July 20, 2025. **Authentication Issues Resolved** - Fixed 500 internal server error during login caused by corrupted template literal in security-monitor.ts (line 116 had corrupted baseUrl reference). Root cause: password hash mismatch for bill.dittman@gmail.com user. Updated user password hash to match "admin123" password. Fixed security monitor logEvent function to generate proper unique IDs instead of referencing undefined variables. Login authentication now working correctly for all user accounts. Confirmed working credentials: bill.dittman@gmail.com / admin123 (company_admin, Company ID: 29).
- July 20, 2025. **Database Corruption and Technician Count Issues Completely Resolved** - Systematically fixed PostgreSQL operator errors causing "operator does not exist: integer ~ unknown" by replacing regex validation with safe integer casting in rating calculations. Updated getAllCompanies function to properly retrieve technician counts using secure SQL queries with GREATEST/LEAST bounds (1-5 ratings). Database now correctly returns: Mr Sprinkler Repair (10 technicians), Carrollton Sprinkler Repair (1 technician), Pool Allstars (0 technicians). Fixed avgRating calculations to handle non-numeric ratings safely without crashing database queries. Server starts cleanly without database operator errors. Companies management page technician counts now display accurate dynamic data from real database instead of fallback "0 / 10" values.
- July 20, 2025. **Critical Frontend API Issues Completely Resolved** - Fixed all persistent 404 and 400 errors reported in browser console. Eliminated duplicate /api/generate-content endpoint conflict between routes.ts (line 4136) and generate-content.ts router. Added proper direct POST endpoint in generate-content.ts to handle frontend requests expecting {checkInId, contentType} parameters. Fixed review-requests settings endpoints (/api/review-requests/settings GET/PUT) with proper authentication and default settings. Removed 60+ lines of corrupted duplicate code causing TypeScript compilation errors. Both endpoints now fully functional: generate-content produces authentic AI content via OpenAI, review-requests/settings returns proper configuration. All frontend API calls working correctly with proper authentication and data flow.

Fixed critical database persistence issue by removing duplicate mock createSubscriptionPlan method that was preventing plans from saving to database. Fixed payment flow issue where development mode was automatically bypassing Stripe payment forms - changed to only bypass when BYPASS_STRIPE environment variable is explicitly set. "Restore Service Now" button provides seamless 4-step flow: (1) Trial expired notification, (2) Plan selection from admin-created plans, (3) Stripe payment/credit card form, (4) Success confirmation with service restoration. System dynamically uses subscription plans created through the admin subscription plans management interface (/subscription-plans-management) with proper database persistence. Trial expired modal automatically displays available plans configured by super admins with smart badge assignment (Popular for "professional" plans, Required for lower-cost options). Enhanced trial messaging to emphasize that payment is mandatory after 14 days - no exceptions. System enforces trial limits through middleware and requires payment for service restoration. Completely flexible plan structure - admins can create any number of plans with custom pricing, features, and limits. All four steps of payment flow now working correctly with Stripe integration.
