# Production Database Connection Fix - June 26, 2025

## Issue Identified ❌

Your DATABASE_URL environment variable is correctly configured on Render.com, but the application is experiencing **connection timeout errors**:

```
NeonDbError: Error connecting to database: fetch failed
ConnectTimeoutError: Connect Timeout Error (timeout: 10000ms)
```

## Root Cause
The default 10-second connection timeout is insufficient for the production environment's network conditions between Render and Neon database.

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Increased Connection Timeouts
- **Connection timeout**: 10s → 30s
- **Statement timeout**: 15s → 30s  
- **Fetch timeout**: 15s → 30s
- **Idle timeout**: 15s → 30s

### 2. Enhanced Retry Logic
- **Max retries**: 3 → 5 attempts
- **Backoff strategy**: Up to 30 seconds for connection errors
- **Better error detection**: Specifically handles `UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`

### 3. Optimized Connection Pool
- **Pool size**: Reduced to 3 connections for better management
- **Max uses**: Reduced to 50 per connection
- **Enhanced error handling**: Connection-specific retry logic

## Database Configuration Status ✅

Your DATABASE_URL environment variable is properly set:
```
postgresql://rankitpro_database_user_chVJdmyJabIrnabJMnZqu1Y4aCl1rvOobzgp-d16peb1dbo4e73cnu7f0-q-virginia-postgres.render.com/rankitpro_database
```

**No changes needed to your environment variables.**

## Expected Result
The platform should now successfully connect to your Neon database without timeout errors, allowing the super admin login to work properly.

## Next Steps
1. The application will automatically restart with these fixes
2. Try logging in again with your super admin credentials
3. Monitor the logs for successful database connections
