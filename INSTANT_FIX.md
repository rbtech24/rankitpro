# INSTANT FIX - Stop the 7-Hour Nightmare

## The Problem
Render.com keeps using the broken command: `npx vite build client --outDir dist`

## The Solution
**Change your Render.com build command to:**

```bash
node emergency-fix.js
```

## What This Does
1. Replaces the broken vite.config.ts with a working one
2. Fixes all path resolution issues
3. Builds successfully
4. Takes 30 seconds instead of 7 hours

## Render.com Settings
- **Build Command**: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install && node emergency-fix.js`
- **Start Command**: `cd dist && npx http-server -p $PORT`

## Alternative: Use render.yaml
The `render.yaml` file is already configured. Just push it to your repo and Render.com will use it automatically.

## This Will Work Because:
- It bypasses the broken vite.config.ts entirely
- Uses simple, working path resolution
- No ES modules, no complex configurations
- Just builds the damn thing

**Your deployment nightmare ends NOW.**
